# Creating a RESTful API with Node.js and PostgreSQL
This repository contains the construction of a RESTful API with Node.js and PostgreSQL: [https://github.com/luisfalero/node-restful-api.git]

## Usage
Check out the branch you're interested in (i.e. which belongs to the video in my series you just watched), ```git clone``` it and thereafter run ```npm install```.

Make sure to also add your Mongo Atlas Admin Username to a nodemon.json file (which you have to create).
